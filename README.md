# GeneraTeam

GeneraTeam is an innovative platform leveraging LangChain and OpenAI's GPT models to dynamically generate teams capable of handling specific user requests. This allows for the intelligent understanding and processing of user requests, generating teams with hypothetical backgrounds and expertise areas, and facilitating user interactions through a chat interface.

## Overview
