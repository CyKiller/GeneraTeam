# GeneraTeam

GeneraTeam is an innovative platform that leverages advanced technologies like LangChain and OpenAI's GPT models to dynamically generate virtual teams. These teams are designed to handle specific user requests, ranging from simple tasks to complex projects. By intelligently understanding and processing user requests, GeneraTeam creates teams with hypothetical backgrounds and expertise areas, facilitating seamless user interactions through a chat interface.

## Overview

GeneraTeam integrates advanced technologies such as OpenAI's GPT for natural language processing and LangChain for workflow management. The application's architecture is built on Node.js and Express for the backend, with MongoDB serving as the database for data persistence. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a simple and intuitive user experience. This blend of technologies ensures that GeneraTeam can efficiently process user requests, generate virtual teams, and facilitate user-team interactions.
